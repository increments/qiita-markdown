      # A filter for simplifying document structure by removing complex markups
      # (mainly block elements) and complex contents.
      #
      # The logic of this filter is similar to the `FinalSanitizer` filter, but this
      # does not use the `sanitize` gem internally for the following reasons:
      #
      # * Each filter should do only its own responsibility, and this filter is
      #   _not_ for sanitization.
      #
      # * The `sanitize` gem automatically adds extra transformers even if we
      #   want to clean up only some elements, and they would be run in the
      #   `FinalSanitizer` filter later.
